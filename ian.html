10 facts about me:
<ol>
<li>My favorite animal is the owl, because I read about then at a young age</li>
<li>My favorite color is blue, so I used light blue on this webpage, and I thought that it would be nice to have a color that is easy on the eyes</li>
<li>I have a Toshiba laptop, and favour windows over macintosh, mainy because i am comfortable with the conventions of windows</li>
<li></li>
